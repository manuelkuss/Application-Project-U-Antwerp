Coding task

To help us evaluate your coding and design skills, we ask you to complete a short take-home task. Please submit your solution by Wednesday, November 19, by replying to this email with your code and a brief explanation of your approach.

Task overview: Develop a small web-based application that visualizes peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) obtained from mass spectrometry data.

Detailed requirements:

    Input:
        Read MS/MS spectra from an MGF file.
        Read PSMs from an mzTab file generated by our Casanovo de novo peptide sequencing tool.
    Processing:
        Match spectra from the MGF file to corresponding PSMs from the mzTab file (based on spectrum identifiers or scan numbers).
        Annotate explained fragment peaks (i.e. those corresponding to predicted fragment ions).
    Visualization:
        Display the spectrum with annotated peaks (e.g. matched vs. unmatched peaks).
        Present the corresponding peptide sequence and PSM metadata.
        Implement this as an interactive, intuitive web interface (you can use any framework or library of your choice).
    Documentation:
        Briefly document your implementation choices, including libraries used, design decisions, and assumptions.
        You may submit your code as a GitHub repository link or as a zip file.
